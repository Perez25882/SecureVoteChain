## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Technical Design

SecureVoteChain employs a modern web architecture that combines blockchain technology with conventional web development practices:

```

│                 │     │                 │     │                 │

         │                       │
         │                       │
         ▼                       ▼

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

The system consists of four key layers:

1. **User Interface Layer**: React-based frontend with Tailwind CSS styling for responsive design
2. **Application Logic Layer**: Redux for state management combined with React contexts
3. **Integration Layer**: ThirdWeb SDK and custom middleware for blockchain interaction
4. **Blockchain Layer**: Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum for secure vote recording and verification

This architecture ensures separation of concerns while maintaining a seamless user experience across different roles.

### 2.2 Smart Contract Implementation

The blockchain foundation of SecureVoteChain consists of four core smart contracts:

#### VotingSystem Contract

The central contract that orchestrates the entire election process:

- Manages the election lifecycle (creation, start, pause, end)
- Implements role-based permissions for administrators
- Maintains election metadata (title, description, dates)
- Provides election status and results queries

#### VoterRegistry Contract

Manages voter identities and participation:

- Links voter ID verification to blockchain wallet addresses
- Prevents double voting through participation tracking
- Maintains the list of eligible voters
- Handles voter registration and verification

#### CandidateRegistry Contract

Manages candidate information:

- Stores candidate details (name, party, information, image)
- Tracks approval status for each candidate
- Provides candidate listing and filtering functionality
- Maintains vote totals for each candidate

#### BallotSystem Contract

Handles the core voting operations:

- Records votes securely on the blockchain
- Ensures vote integrity and prevents tampering
- Provides real-time vote counting mechanisms
- Maintains anonymity between voter identity and vote choice

### 2.3 Data Flow and Persistence

Data in SecureVoteChain flows through several persistence layers:

#### Blockchain Storage (Permanent)

- **Election Configuration**: Core parameters like title, dates, and status
- **Voter Registration**: Verified voter addresses and participation status
- **Vote Records**: Actual votes cast, linked to candidates but not to voter identities
- **Candidate Information**: Official candidate records and approval status

#### Frontend State (Temporary)

- **UI State**: Current view configurations and form data
- **Session Data**: Current user role and authentication status
- **Cached Results**: Local copies of blockchain data for performance

#### Redux Store (Application State)

- **Election Data**: Current election details and status
- **Candidate List**: Candidate information and stats
- **Voter Information**: Data specific to the current voter
- **Authentication State**: User login status and role information

Data flow within the system follows event-driven principles:

1. User actions trigger Redux actions or direct ThirdWeb calls
2. Smart contract state changes emit blockchain events
3. Frontend subscribes to these events for real-time updates
4. UI components re-render based on updated Redux state

### 2.4 Security Measures

SecureVoteChain implements multiple layers of security:

#### Authentication Security

- **Dual-Factor Authentication**: Requires both voter ID verification and wallet signature
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict separation between voter and administrator capabilities
- **Admin Authentication**: Additional password protection for administrative functions

#### Data Security

- **Blockchain Immutability**: Once recorded, votes cannot be altered
- **Personal Data Protection**: Minimal personal data stored on-chain
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive information is encrypted before storage

#### Smart Contract Security

- **Access Control Modifiers**: Functions restricted to appropriate roles
- **Input Validation**: Thorough checking of all user inputs
- **OpenZeppelin Standards**: Industry-standard security libraries for common functions

#### Frontend Security

- **XSS Protection**: Guards against cross-site scripting attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure API Communication**: Protected endpoints for data exchange
