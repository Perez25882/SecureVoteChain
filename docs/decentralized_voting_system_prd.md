## 2. Technical Specifications

### 2.1 Requirements Analysis

The modernized decentralized voting system requires a robust blockchain implementation with advanced security features, real-time data synchronization, and a dual-interface design that separates voter and administrator experiences. The system must maintain the integrity of the democratic process through secure identity verification while providing transparent and accessible voting mechanisms.

The solution must be built on Ethereum using either Hardhat or Thirdweb development frameworks with a React frontend to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface. Smart contracts will handle critical voting logic, user authentication, and vote tallying while the frontend will provide differentiated experiences based on user roles.

Real-time result tracking requires efficient data indexing and event listening capabilities, while the integration of wallet connections with voter IDs demands a secure verification protocol to prevent fraud while maintaining voter privacy.
