### 4.4 State Management

SecureVoteChain uses Redux for global state management with the following key slices:

#### Election Slice

Manages the state related to elections:

- Current election details
- List of candidates
- Election statistics
- Loading states and errors

Key actions include:
- `fetchElectionDetails`: Gets current election data
- `createOrUpdateElection`: Creates or updates an election
- `updateElectionState`: Changes the election state (start/pause/end)

#### Candidate Slice

Manages candidate-related state:

- Candidate listings
- Approval statuses
- Vote counts

Key actions include:
- `fetchCandidates`: Gets all candidates
- `addCandidate`: Adds a new candidate
- `updateCandidate`: Updates candidate information
- `deleteCandidate`: Removes a candidate

#### Authentication Context

Handles user authentication state:

- Current user information
- Login status
- User role (voter or admin)

Key functions include:
- `login`: Authenticates admin users
- `logout`: Removes authentication
- `connectWallet`: Connects to Ethereum wallet
- `disconnectWallet`: Disconnects the wallet

## 5. Installation and Deployment

## 6. Troubleshooting and FAQ

### 6.1 Common Issues

#### Wallet Connection Issues

**Problem**: Unable to connect MetaMask wallet

**Solutions**:
- Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- Check that you're on the correct network
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
- Clear browser cache and try again

#### Transaction Failures

**Problem**: Transactions fail or remain pending

**Solutions**:
- Check that you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
- Try increasing the gas limit
- Check network congestion and try again later
- Ensure you're using the correct wallet address

#### Admin Access Issues

**Problem**: Cannot access administrative functions

**Solutions**:
- Verify you're using the correct admin credentials (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`)
- Ensure your wallet address has admin privileges
- Clear cookies and try logging in again
- Check console for specific error messages

### 6.2 FAQ

**Q: Can I use SecureVoteChain for legally binding elections?**

A: SecureVoteChain provides a technical foundation for secure voting, but legal requirements for official elections vary by jurisdiction. Consult legal experts before using for official government elections.

**Q: What happens if a voter loses access to their wallet?**

A: The Electoral Commission would need to implement a recovery procedure involving identity verification before re-linking the voter to a new wallet. This should be handled carefully to prevent vote fraud.

**Q: How much does it cost to run an election?**

A: The cost varies based on the number of voters and transactions. On Ethereum mainnet, you should budget for gas fees for contract deployment (one-time) and transaction fees for each vote. Using Layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce these costs.

**Q: Is voting anonymous?**

A: Yes and no. The system is designed so that votes cannot be easily traced back to specific voters. However, with blockchain forensics, it may be theoretically possible to link votes to wallets under certain circumstances. The system prioritizes verifiability while providing reasonable privacy.

**Q: Can election parameters be changed after voting begins?**

A: No, core election parameters (title, dates) cannot be modified once voting has started. The Electoral Commission can pause or end the election but cannot change its fundamental configuration.
