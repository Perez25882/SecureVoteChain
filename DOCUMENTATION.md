# SecureVoteChain - Implementation Documentation

## Project Overview
SecureVoteChain is a decentralized voting application built on blockchain technology. This document explains the implementation details, recent fixes, and how to test the application.

## Implementation and Bug Fixes

### Redux Implementation Fixes
1. **CandidateManagement Component**
   - Fixed how candidate updates are passed to the Redux store
   - Updated the `updateCandidate` function call to correctly structure the data by separating the candidate ID from the update fields
   - Previous implementation passed the entire candidate object in updates, causing conflicts
   - New implementation extracts only the required fields for update (name, party, information, imageReference)

2. **Redux Flow**
   - Our Redux implementation uses the following flow:
     - Actions are created using Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk`
     - Each action handles its specific data manipulation (create, read, update, delete)
     - The data is persisted in localStorage for development purposes
     - In a production environment, these actions would call smart contract functions

## Testing the Application

### How to Test the Electoral Commission Features

1. **Accessing EC Dashboard**
   - Navigate to the homepage
   - Click on "EC Login" in the top navigation bar
   - Use the following credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`
   - You should be directed to the EC Dashboard with overview statistics

2. **Managing Elections**
   - From the EC Dashboard, click on "Election Management" 
   - Create a new election by filling in the title, description, and date fields
   - After creating an election, test the election controls:
     - Start Election
     - Pause Election
     - Resume Election
     - End Election

3. **Managing Candidates**
   - Navigate to "Candidate Management" from the dashboard or sidebar
   - Add a new candidate with required details (Name, Party)
   - Edit an existing candidate to verify the fixes we implemented
   - Approve/revoke approval for candidates
   - Delete candidates if needed

4. **Managing Voters**
   - Navigate to "Voter Management" from the dashboard or sidebar
   - Register new voters using wallet addresses
   - Verify voters or revoke verification
   - Use the filters to view different voter categories (Verified, Unverified, Voted, Not Voted)

### How to Test Voter Features

1. **Voter Login**
   - Connect a wallet by clicking "Connect Wallet" on the homepage
   - A verified voter will be able to access the voter dashboard

2. **Voting Process**
   - Navigate to the voting page during an active election
   - Select a candidate to vote for
   - Submit your vote and confirm the transaction
   - Verify that you cannot vote again

3. **Viewing Results**
   - After voting or when an election ends, navigate to the Results page
   - View detailed vote counts and percentages

## Known Limitations in Development Version

1. **Wallet Integration**
   - The current implementation uses a simulated wallet connection
   - In production, this would connect to actual Ethereum wallets through MetaMask

2. **Smart Contracts**
   - The smart contracts are defined but not deployed in this development version
   - Data persistence is handled through localStorage for testing purposes

3. **Security Features**
   - Some security controls like two-factor authentication are UI only in the development version
   - Full implementation would include proper cryptographic verification

## Next Steps for Production

1. Deploy smart contracts to a test network (Sepolia/Goerli)
2. Connect frontend to deployed contracts using ThirdWeb SDK
3. Implement proper wallet authentication and verification
4. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
